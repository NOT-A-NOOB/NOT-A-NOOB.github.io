          <h4 class="post-title">Why does human have such petty worries?</h4>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Hi you all, my name is <em>Small Cat </em> *wink* and today I happened to stumble upon this ugly and messy of a webpage. After seeing the previous post from the author, I have to say I really don't understand why you humans can have such petty worries like being afraid of <em>jealousy</em> and <em>rumours</em> *frown*. Take us cat for example, we have to worry about stuff like finding good places to take a nap or nagging human constantly for food or chasing other cats across the roof so that they won't steal my food or etc. etc. <strong>MEOW</strong> (Like I have to nag this bearded fatass in the picture who is my <strong><em>"owner"</em></strong> >_< that i'm sitting on 3 times per day just to be given some measly little food *shudder*. Why won't he just remember to put a lot of food in my bowl everytime i'm hungry <strong>MEOW</strong>). So as you all can see, our worries are <strong>much much bigger</strong> than yours *heart*. Anyway that's all I have to say for the moment, now I must go nagging that fatso to give me more food as my bowl is empty yet again *sigh*. <e>Bye for now!</em></p>
            <p>P.S: BTW i'm <strong>NOT</strong> a cat (the avatar and my username is just for  roleplaying) so don't take my opinions lightly, <strong>MEOW!</strong></p>

          <h4 class="post-title">Ending my career as a web developer</h4>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>After a long time working as a up-and-coming talented web developer, I realized that no matter how hard I tried I'd always invoke <en>jealousy</em> among my co-workers because of my talent. So on this day, <em>July the 4th</em>, I've decided to quit being a web developer <strong>forever</strong>. I'm truly sorry for the industry for having lost a <em>major talent</em> such as myself! :)</p>
            <p>By the way, <strong>I'm a free agent now</strong> so if you have any need of my outrageous skills, please don't be hesitate to contact me through my Facebook or Twitter (links at the bottom of the blog), <strong>OR</strong> you can email me at <a href="mailto:dophuc24895@gmail.com">dophuc24895@gmail.com</a>. Hope you all have a good day and I'll be seeing you soon. <em>Peace!</em></p>
